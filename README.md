# Photoshop Resize Scripts
Resizing various photos for marketing purposes for web, social media, and email lists is time consuming. Here are some scripts to do quickly.

Here are some scripts that I use to batch resize photos for Squarespace, Instagram, Facebook, and Mailchimp.

## How to use?
1. Download the script files to your computer.
2. Open Adobe Photoshop.
3. Click "File" -> "Scripts" -> "Browse".
4. Select which script file that you want to run.
5. A dialog box will open asking which folder of jpg photos that you want to resize.
6. After selecting the folder, the script will run; so, sit back and wait.

## Details
1. The scripts will resize all .jpgs in the folder that you select.
2. The resize photos will be stored a subfolder called "Resize" with the width of the photo appended to the end of the original file name.

## ProTips:
1. Set up a keyboard shortcut instead of clicking "File" -> "Scripts" -> "Browse" everytime you want to run your script. I have mine setup as "Ctrl + Alt + ."
